# CloudFormation Resource Specification

The AWS CloudFormation resource specification is a JSON-formatted text file that defines the resources and properties that AWS CloudFormation supports.

> [!NOTE]
> This spec is not being updated anymore. It has been frozen in place to record the types
> as they were at a particular point in time. This allows us to detect incompatible changes
> to the types between the legcy spec and the registry schema, without introducing another
> history-keeping mechanism just yet.
