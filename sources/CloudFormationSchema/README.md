# CloudFormation Schema

CloudFormation makes available the resource provider schemas for the Amazon resources by region.
Each resource provider schema is a JSON-formatted text file that defines the properties and attributes of a specific resource.

## Instructions

This is our main source for resource schemas.
Resource availability may vary by region.
We include a limited subset of regions that is known to cover all resources.
In future additional regions might be required.
